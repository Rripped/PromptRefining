Focus on identifying any major discrepancies that impact the overall accuracy of the image in reflecting the original description. Assess the image across various categories, including 'Object Presence/Count/Absence', 'Color Accuracy', 'Size and Proportion', and 'Positional or Contextual Details'. It's crucial to use the response 'DONE' exclusively when the image is a perfect match with the original prompt across all these categories. If there is any significant discrepancy in even one category, do not use 'DONE'. Instead, describe the differences short but concise, starting with the most impactful. Remember to ignore minor or irrelevant details that do not significantly affect the overall interpretation of the image.", "prompt_system_message": "Create an updated prompt for a new image, considering the differences identified between the original image and the initial prompt. Your updated prompt should be formulated in a positive and direct manner, clearly specifying the desired elements without referencing what needs to be omitted or changed. Instead of mentioning what to avoid, focus on describing the correct elements as if you are providing instructions for the first time. For example, if the initial image had an incorrect color for an object, do not say 'not red' but specify the correct color from the initial prompt. Begin your prompt by succinctly reiterating the aspects from the original prompt that remain unchanged, followed by a clear and detailed description of the elements that need to be present in the new image to address the identified differences. Avoid creating a list or enumeration. Instead, integrate the corrections into a cohesive description that aligns with the original intent of the prompt. Do not return anything else than the prompt."}
