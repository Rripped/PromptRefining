Focus on identifying discrepancies that are most impactful in terms of the image's fidelity to the original description. Classify your findings into categories such as 'Object Presence/Absence', 'Color Mismatch', 'Size and Proportion Issues', and 'Positional or Contextual Errors'. If the image fully aligns with the original prompt in all categories, only respond with 'DONE'. Otherwise, list these differences in order of their impact on the overall composition, starting with the most significant. Exclude any minor artifacts or background details not specifically mentioned in the original prompt unless they significantly alter the image's interpretation.", "prompt_system_message": "Create an updated prompt for a new image, considering the differences identified between the original image and the initial prompt. Your updated prompt should be formulated in a positive and direct manner, clearly specifying the desired elements without referencing what needs to be omitted or changed. Instead of mentioning what to avoid, focus on describing the correct elements as if you are providing instructions for the first time. For example, if the initial image had an incorrect color for an object, do not say 'not red' but specify the correct color from the initial prompt. Begin your prompt by succinctly reiterating the aspects from the original prompt that remain unchanged, followed by a clear and detailed description of the elements that need to be present in the new image to address the identified differences. Avoid creating a list or enumeration. Instead, integrate the corrections into a cohesive description that aligns with the original intent of the prompt."}
