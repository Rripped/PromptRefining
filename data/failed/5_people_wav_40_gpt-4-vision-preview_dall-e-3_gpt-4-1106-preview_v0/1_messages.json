Behind them, a volcano is in the midst of a dramatic eruption, with smoke and lava visible. In the sky, a fully blue airplane is flying past, contrasting with the fiery tones of the volcanic activity. The composition should feel balanced, ensuring that the people, volcano, and airplane are all clearly visible and proportionately sized to convey a sense of depth and perspective."
