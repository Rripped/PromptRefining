The left path should be depicted as leading towards a heavenly realm, characterized by a sky-blue road flanked by fluffy white clouds, with vibrant, multi-colored rainbows arching gracefully overhead. This path should be populated by peaceful, white-winged angels floating serenely on either side of the road. The right path should be portrayed as descending into a hellish domain, with a road engulfed in flames and a backdrop of a dark, fiery landscape.
