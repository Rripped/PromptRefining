# Data

Iterations should land here in a folder named like `<sd/dal>_<max_iters>_<first 2 words of the prompt>_<version>`.\\
sd = stable diffusion, dal = dalle 3.\\
Where version is a number starting at 0 incremented for each iteration (if we run the same config multiple times).

Inside the folder there should be a `config.json` file containing the config used for the iteration.\\
The initial prompt should be stored as `prompt.md`. \\

and the following files (per iteration):\\
In there each difference description should be stored as `<iteration>-differences.md` and the corresponding image as `<iteration>-image.png.`
