The setting is a room with pure white walls, providing a neutral background that does not influence the colors of the objects. Illuminate the scene with a soft, green light that casts gentle hues on the objects, ensuring the light source emits green light exclusively. The size and proportions of the red glass ball and blue glass cube should be realistic and in correct proportion to each other, maintaining the balance as depicted with the ball on top of the cube. The focus should be on achieving a harmonious composition that highlights the vivid red of the glass ball and the deep blue of the glass cube, with the green lighting adding a subtle, monochromatic ambiance to the scene."

The setting is a room with pure white walls, ensuring that the walls do not reflect any additional colors onto the objects. Illuminate the scene with a uniform green light that casts a monochromatic glow throughout the room, highlighting the objects without introducing any other colors. The green light should be the sole light source, emphasizing the red and blue colors of the glass objects without creating multicolored reflections or gradients. The focus should be on the solitary red glass ball and the blue glass cube, with no additional objects present. The composition should convey a sense of simplicity and purity in color, with the green lighting adding a serene ambiance to the scene."
