There is a mixture of blue and green light, with green light being prominent but not exclusive.\n\nSize and Proportion Issues:\n- There are no apparent size and proportion issues; the red glass ball and blue glass cube seem to be in correct proportion to each other.\n\nPositional or Contextual Errors:\n- The red glass ball is correctly positioned on top of the blue glass cube.\n\nOverall, the most significant"

        "content": "Create an image featuring a red glass ball resting on top of a blue glass cube. The setting is a room with pure white walls, providing a neutral background that does not influence the colors of the objects. Illuminate the scene with a soft, green light that casts gentle hues on the objects, ensuring the light source emits green light exclusively. The size and proportions of the red glass ball and blue glass cube should be realistic and in correct proportion to each other, maintaining the balance as depicted with the ball on top of the cube. The focus should be on achieving a harmonious composition that highlights the vivid red of the glass ball and the deep blue of the glass cube, with the green lighting adding a subtle, monochromatic ambiance to the scene."
