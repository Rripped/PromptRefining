Ensure that the glass of the house is not tinted or colored in any way, including avoiding any yellow hue that might suggest the glass itself is yellow or affected by lighting conditions. The house should be distinctly depicted with four separate and clearly defined floors, avoiding any additional levels or complexity that would suggest more than four floors."
