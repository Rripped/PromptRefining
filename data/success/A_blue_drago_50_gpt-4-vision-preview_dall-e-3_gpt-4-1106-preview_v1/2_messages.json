        "content": "Please create a dynamic scene featuring a confrontation between a blue dragon and a distinctly yellow turtle. The background should showcase a modern cityscape during the night, with street lights illuminating the environment. A green airplane should be included, flying in the sky above the skirmishing creatures. Additionally, incorporate a small spider on the turtle's back, ensuring it is noticeable but proportionate to the turtle. The overall composition should capture the intensity of the battle between the dragon and the turtle, with the city and passing airplane as secondary elements that add depth and context to the scene."
