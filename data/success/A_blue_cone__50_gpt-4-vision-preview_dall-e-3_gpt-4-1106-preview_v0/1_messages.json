There is also a black ball, but it is not positioned behind both objects as described; instead, it is placed in front of the cube and to the right of the cone, partially obstructing the view of the cube. All objects are indeed placed in a room that appears to be white, given the light walls and floor.\n\nTo summarize, the discrepancies are:\n- The black ball is not behind both the blue cone and the red cube; it is positioned in front of the cube and to the right of the cone.\n\nThese are the significant discrepancies in the image when compared to the original description."

Ensure that a black ball is situated behind both the blue cone and the red cube, so that it is partially visible from the viewer's perspective. The room should have light walls and a floor, maintaining a clean and simple aesthetic that emphasizes the objects."
